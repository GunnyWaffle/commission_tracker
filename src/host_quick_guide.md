### As a Host, you will need to...

* Keep an eye on the New Commissions queue.
* Assign any new commissions to the correct queues.
* If Artists with empty queues aren't taking commissions, assign commissions to them.
* Keep an eye on chat and answer any questions people may have about their commissions.
