Welcome to the help guide for the Commission Tracker for Hosts!

Your duty as the host is to keep things running as smoothly for the Artists as possible.

## User Management

One way you will be helping the Artist is to handle adding new users, changing passwords, etc. If you scroll down to the bottom of your page, you can see the **Users** section where you'll find a table of all users in the Commission Tracker database.

These users have three roles:

* God: This is a hardcoded user in the Commission Tracker. You cannot make any changes to this role, so don't even try. ;) 
* Admin: This is your role. God and Admins share the same abilities to edit users, manage commissions, etc. The only difference is that only God can make changes to any user with the Admin role. (Note: The name of this role will be changed to "Host" in the near future)
* User: This is the role all Artists will have. (Note: The name of this role will be changed to "Artist" in the near future)

You can view the Username, Full Name, and Role of each user, as well as if they're an Artist and if their queue is open. 

You can make the following changes to each user, by clicking the button with the corresponding emoji:

* üá∫ Change Username: Changes the username of the given user. This is the username they use to login to the Commission Tracker. After changing this, the user will need to close and reopen their browser to be prompted to log back in.
* üá´ Change Full Name: Changes the full name/displayed name of the given user.
* üîí Change Password: Changes the password of the given user. After changing this, the user will need to close and reopen their browser to be prompted to log back in.
* ‚ùå Delete User: Deletes the given user. *This cannot be undone!*

Additionally, you can change whether a given user is treated as an Artist, and if their Queue is open, by clicking the corresponding checkmark.

Lastly, you can add new users using the "**Add new user**" form. You can only create users with the Admin and User roles.

## Commission Queues

The main part of the Commission Tracker website is the commission queues. Here you can see all new commissions that have been received from Ko-fi, all commissions that are assigned to particular Artists, all commissions that are available to be assigned to/claimed by Artists, and all finish commissions.

You can show or hide any commission queue by clicking the checkbox beside the queue.

All commissions initially display in their compact form, with their details hidden. To show the details of any commission, just click the commission name. To hide the commission details, just click the name again.

### New Commissions

When new commissions come in from Ko-fi, due to a quirk in Ko-fi's system, the Commission Tracker can't automatically determine if these commissions should be made available for any Artist to claim, or assigned to a specific Artist. This will have to be your job. Until these commissions are remove from the New Commissions queue, *Artists will not be able to see them.*

Click the "Link to commission details" hyperlink to determine what queue the commission should go into. If it's a commission for any Artist, select "Any Artist" from the "Assign to an artist:" dropdown. If it's a commission for a specific Artist, select their name. Then, click the "Assign" button. *Note: During testing, these links will be fake, so just make stuff up.*

Note that any commissions assigned directly to Artists from this queue will be marked as ‚≠ê Exclusive, meaning they're intended to be *only* picked up by that Artist. 

### Assigning/Unassigning Commissions

One job you'll have as a Host is to help manage the queues of Artists, in case they get overwhelmed, or they start to run out of time, or perhaps if they simply don't realize they have run out of commissions and need to have new ones assigned to them. You can assign or unassign commissions to Artists at any time using the "Assign to an artist:" dropdown in the commission details.

### Commission Queue Metrics

When things get busy, there can be a lot of commissions in all the queues, and it can get hard to keep track of which Artists have how many commissions assigned to them. For this, each user's commission queue has metrics beside them in the form of emoji on colored backgrounds. At a glance, you can see how many commissions the Artist has ‚úã Assigned to them, and how many of those commissions they have ‚ùå Not Yet Accepted.

### Finished Commissions

After an Artist finishes a commission, they will upload the image file to the commission and click the üéâ Finished button. You can see these commissions in the **Finished commissions** queue, and also see what filename the commission's picture was saved as.

### Opening/Closing Commissions Queues

When an Artist is unavailable to work, it's a good idea to close their commission queue. This puts a strikethrough effect on their commissions queue's name. You can toggle whether an Artist's commissions queue is opened or closed in the **Users** section. 

Having a closed queue doesn't stop the Artist from claiming commissions, but it does mean their name won't show up in the "Assign to an artist:" dropdown, so Hosts won't be able to assign that Artist any commissions.
