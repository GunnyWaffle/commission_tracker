### As an Artist, you will need to...

* Keep an eye on your "Commissions assigned to me" queue for new incoming commissions.
* ❌ Reject a commission if you don't want to work on it.
* When you've finished a commission, use the file uploader on your commission, then click the "Click here to confirm" link to upload the commission and mark it as Finished. 
* When you're ready to add another commission to your queue, you may ✋ Claim new commissions from the "Available Commissions" queue.
* To stop receiving new commissions, uncheck the ☑️ **Queue Open?** checkbox in the top right of the page and let the hosts know you're no longer accepting commissions.
