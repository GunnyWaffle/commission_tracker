Welcome to the help guide for the Commission Tracker for Hosts!

As an Artist, our hope is that the Commission Tracker will help you manage your commissions queues during busy streams!

## Commission Queues

The main part of the Commission Tracker website is the commission queues. There, you can see all commissions that are assigned to you, all commissions that are assigned to other Artists, all commissions that are available to be claimed, and all finished commissions.

You can <img style="height: 0.9em;" src="/static/img/eye-solid.svg"> Show or <img style="height: 0.9em;" src="/static/img/eye-slash-solid.svg"> Hide any commission queue by clicking the eye icon beside the queue.

### Commissions Details

All commissions initially display in their compact form, with their details hidden. To show the details of any commission, just click the commission name. To hide the commission details, just click the name again.

Due to a quirk in Ko-fi's system, the Commissions Tracker can't automatically fill out the details of the commissions. Instead, it provides a link to the details on Ko-fi's website. Clicking this link will open those details in a new tab. You *do not* need to be logged in to Ko-fi to view these commission details. *Note: During testing, some of these links will be fake, so feel free to just pretend to do them. Just, I dunno, wave your stylus at your tablet in a vaguely threatening manner or something. Show it who's boss.*

*Note:* There is a bug on Ko-fi's website where refreshing the commissions details tab can sometimes cause the commission details to disappear. If this happens, close that tab and click the link from the commissions details on the Commission Tracker again. 

### Your Commissions

These are the commissions that were assigned to you, either because a commissioner requested the commission be done by you specifically, or a Host thought you looked bored and needed something to do. ;)

Any commissions that a commissioner bought from you specifically are ⭐ Exclusive commissions, and will have that star emoji beside them. *These commissions should be prioritized because they cannot be reassigned to other Artists.*

You will see ❌ Reject buttons next to your commissions. If you don't want to work on a commission, click the ❌ Reject button. You are allowed to Reject commissions for any reason, including if you feel are they offensive, abusive, too complex, or even just not your cup of tea. This will move the commission out of your queue so it can be assigned to a different Artist.

### Available Commissions

If you've run out of commissions to finish, check the "Available commissions" queue. This is where commissions that can be completed by any Artist are placed. If there are any commissions you'd like to work on, click the ✋ Claim button to take that commission into your queue. You can always ❌ Reject a commission later, even if you previously Claimed it.

You can even Claim commissions from other Artist's queues if necessary. Please check with the Artist first before doing this.

### Finishing Commissions

When you've finished a commission, save the commission as an image file. Then, open the commission details. You can then either drag the image file into the area with the dashed outline to select that file for uploading, or click the blue "clicking this link" text to open a file browser. Once you've selected an image file to upload, you can click the blue "upload it" text, or select a new image file. Clicking "upload it" will remove the commission from your queue, upload your image file to the website, and mark the commission as Finished. 

You can claim any commission from the Finished queue if you wish to do more work on it.

### Opening/Closing Commissions Queues

When you are done working for the day, it's a good idea to close your commission queue. This puts a strikethrough effect on your queue's name on everyone else's screen. You can toggle whether your queue is opened or closed by clicking the ☑️ **Queue Open?** checkbox in the top right of the page.
