Welcome to the help guide for the Commission Tracker for Hosts!

As an Artist, our hope is that the Commission Tracker will help you manage your commissions queues during busy streams!

## Commission Queues

The main part of the Commission Tracker website is the commission queues. Here you can see all commissions that are assigned to you, all commissions that are assigned to other Artists, all commissions that are available to be claimed, and all finish commissions.

You can show or hide any commission queue by clicking the checkbox beside the queue.

### Commissions Details

All commissions initially display in their compact form, with their details hidden. To show the details of any commission, just click the commission name. To hide the commission details, just click the name again.

Due to a quirk in Ko-fi's system, the Commissions Tracker can't automatically fill out the details of the commissions. Instead, it provides a link to the details on Ko-fi's website. Clicking this link will open those details in a new tab. You *do not* need to be logged in to Ko-fi to view these commission details. *Note: During testing, these links will be fake, so feel free to just pretend to do them. Just, I dunno, wave your stylus at your tablet in a vaguely threatening manner or something. Show it who's boss.*

*Note:* There is a bug on Ko-fi's website where refreshing the commissions details tab can sometimes cause the commission details to disappear. If this happens, close that tab and click the link from the commissions details on Commission Tracker again. 

### Your Commissions

These are the commissions that were assigned to you, either because a commissioner requested the commission be done by you specifically, or a Host thought you looked bored and needed something to do. ;)

Any commissions that the commissioner bought from you specifically are ‚≠ê Exclusive commissions, and will have that star emoji beside them. *These commissions should be prioritized because they cannot be reassigned to other Artists.*

You may see ‚úÖ Accept and ‚ùå Reject buttons next to your commissions. After a commission was assigned to you, you should look through the commission details and determine if this is a commission you're willing to work on. You are not required to work on commissions that you feel are offensive, abusive, too complex, etc.

If you don't want to work on a commission, click the ‚ùå Reject button. This will move the commission out of your queue so it can be assigned to a different Artist. Otherwise, click the ‚úÖ Accept button to signal to the Hosts that you've looked at the commission and are willing to complete it.

### Available Commissions

If you've run out of commissions to finish, check the "Available commissions" queue. This is where commissions that can be completed by any Artist are placed. If there are any commissions you'd like to work on, click the ‚úã Claim button to take that commission into your queue. Claiming a commission will auto-accept it, so you do not need to click the ‚úÖ Accept button after Claiming a commission. You can always ‚ùå Reject a commission, even if you Claimed it.

You can even Claim commissions from other Artist's queues if necessary. Please check with the Artist first before doing this.

### Finishing Commissions

When you've finished a commission, save the commission as an image file. Then, open the commission details. Look for the "Browse..." button next to the "**Upload File:**" text. Click this, and it will open a file select dialog to let you upload your finished image file to the Commission Tracker website.

Once you've selected an image file to upload, the üéâ Finish button will become clickable. Click this, and it will remove the commission from your queue, upload your image file to the website, and mark the commission as Finished.
